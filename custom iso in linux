LINUX CUSTOM ISO:

If you're a linux admin ,you have to install os for multiple computer ,you have to configure that computer for first installing procedure .
Now its take lots of time .
Main point is i'm creating minimal os from full os because i have a low end pc so i create this minimal os .
1. now add one repository (sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/release)
2. update my system and install cubic package (sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install cubic)
Our motive in this note is :
1. Removal of unnecessary packages, making it a minimal ISO of Linux Mint.
2. Update remaining packages to the latest version.
3. Add new background images.
4. Install the latest Linux Kernel (6.0). latest version is 6.2
Now i'm going to purge thunderbird
using : apt purge thunderbird
And i'm going to purge some more packages
(apt purge drawing gnome-calculator hexchat hypnotix libreoffice* onboard redshift redshift-gtk rhythmbox sticky thingy thunderbird warpinator webapp-manager)

Now update this and upgrade this modification
(sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade)

Add few more background images :
goto this dir "cd /usr/share/backgrounds"
Open your images and drag and drop here now its update this images into this background images
Cubic appliaction support drag and drop option so i do that.

Now kernel updating section:
download these 4 links using wget :
1.wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-headers-6.0.0-060000_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_all.deb
2.wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-headers-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb
3.wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb
4.wget https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/linux-modules-6.0.0-060000-generic_6.0.0-060000.202210022231_amd64.deb
because its contains kernel and its header file so doenload this one by one finally install all file using 
#dpkg -i *.deb

Next prompt also showing package removing prompt if you want to remove more package you can
Next  select kernel version and click next
Now compression area :
I'm goint with gzip, it's avarage compression size 
After click Generate button Now its take some time

After complete this entire step cubic have test environmet you can test this iso with tset area .
this is a custom iso creating steps.

This was my take on how you can easily create custom Ubuntu or other Linux distros ISO images using Cubic with its practical usage.
